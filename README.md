# FUTILANG
Useless programming language made in ~2 months. Includes:
- miserable syntax
- all interpreter codebase in single C++ file
- assembly-like features
- about 20% of Python 3.10 speed
- OpenGL
- classes
- goto <3
- raw pointers
- memory leaks
- segmentation faults
- and more...

# Building
1. download the repo in zip file
2. unzip it to `futilang` into your home folder (yeah it best builds on linux)
   ```bash
   unzip -qo futilang.zip
   rm futilang.zip
   ```
3. while not leaving bash after previous commands,
   ```bash
   rm -r futilang
   ```
Done.
